# KinectTracking
A simple app used to demonstrate the target tracking capabilities of the XBox Kinect.

Body frames from the Kinect are used to update a list of currently tracked targets in the app. The relative angle of each target from the Kinect is calculated and printed to the screen using SDL. 

Eventually, this target tracking app will be integrated into our final Senior Design Project.
